### [Quality of Location - Building a New Pitch Metric with R](https://drose1988.github.io/pitch_location_quality_project/)
[<img src="images/6287190ed833f.image.jpg"/>](https://drose1988.github.io/pitch_location_quality_project/)
Introducing a novel pitch metric designed to evaluate the precision of each pitch's location quality by considering various contributing factors. Our investigation will delve into the nuances of location quality across different batting counts, pitch types, and the handedness of hitter/batter combinations. Ultimately, we can compare and contrast the effectiveness of all pitchers in accurately placing their pitches during the 2023 season.
