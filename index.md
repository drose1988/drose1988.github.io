The Winning Playbook is an insightful analysis to explore the performance of NBA teams during the 2021-2022 season. We'll use Tableau to visualize & explore the performance of different basketball teams, and players in a variety of factors, including wins and losses, offensive and defensive efficiency, and individual players' statistics on having the most assists at different positions.
