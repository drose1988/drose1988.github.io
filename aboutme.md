## About Me<br>
Welcome, my name Doug Rose, and I am enthusiastically pursuing a career as a data analyst.

My love for data is rooted in my lifelong passion for baseball and the transformative role that analytics plays in improving our comprehension of the game. The flood of innovation and the open flow of information within the baseball community over the past few decades has not only led me to reevaluate the game through a data-driven lens but has also reshaped my own cognitive perspective, instilling in me an appreciation for the significance of data in shaping our world. This fascination with the evolving landscape of the sport has inspired me to pivot towards a career in data analytics.

Throughout my adult life, I have fortified my communication and team-work skills through experiences working as a bike messenger and electrician. These diverse roles and experiences have fostered my ability to thrive in novel challenges and navigate problem-solving scenarios successfully. Iâ€™ve learned how to excel in the workplace by employing creative approaches to challenges while maintaining a methodical, focused approach. 

As I transition into the field of analytics, I have equipped myself for success by completing a number of comprehensive bootcamps and online specializations. These learning experiences have not only strengthen my technical proficiency in tools like SQL, R, Excel, and Tableau but also built foundational skills necessary to thrive as an entry-level analyst.

Thank you reading! I hope you find my completed projects intriguing and valuable. I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to meet the unique needs of an organization, and look forward to the opportunity.
